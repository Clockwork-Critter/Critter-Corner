The Worldbeast is a long-term worldbuilding project that I have been working on for many years. It tells the story of a world contained inside of the mangled corpse of a dead beast. Worldbeast covers themes of paranoia, insight, and storytelling. It focuses heavily on its mythology and magic to tell its story. Lore, stories, and other details are likely to change as new ideas come and go.
