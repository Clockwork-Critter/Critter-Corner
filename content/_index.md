# About Me
Hi there! I go by the Clockwork Critter and I use she/her and it/its pronouns. I am a Linux Enthusiast, Furry, and Aspiring Data Scientist. I enjoy learning about technology, statistics and data of all kinds, as well as digital privacy. I also enjoy comedy and humor, I am always looking to make those close to me laugh. This website is dedicated to journaling my thoughts as I try finding my place in both the tech industry and the wider world as well as collecting resources that help marginalized people navigate their challenges.
