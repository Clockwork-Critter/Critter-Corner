The Worldbeast is a long term worldbuilding project that I have been working on for a number of years. It tells the story of a world contained inside of the mangled corpse of a dead beast. Worldbeast covers themes of paranoia, insight, and storytelling. It focuses heavily on it's mythology and magic to tell it's story. Lore, stories, and other details are license to change as new ideas come and go.
