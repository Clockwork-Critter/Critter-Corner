## Introduction

How many times have you had this happen? A person joins your community and makes a post asking about how to get their wifi working on Linux. They are new to linux and they have downloaded an .exe file they downloaded somewhere from the internet. Or how about a person who wants to install Linux but can't choose a distribution and asks for the "best one" or better yet wanting to install "Linux" but not knowing what a distribution is. What explains these kinds of missteps? After all a seasoned user would easily point out the mistakes and know where to get more information. The answer lies in a phenomenon called incognizance.

## What is Incognizance?

Incognizance in information science is the state of having a particular information need but being unaware you have this need. Take for a particularly dramatic example: a patient being diagnosed with cancer. They may be so overwhelmed by the diagnosis that they don't have any idea what to ask their doctor. They may need to know how this will affect their day to day life or how to find emotional support but they may not know that they need these things until later. It may help to connect this concept with your life. Can you think of a time that you didn't know what you needed to know?
