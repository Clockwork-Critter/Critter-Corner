### Window's Pros

1. Compatible with most software including games.

    *   If it runs it probably runs on Windows. This incudes really old programs and obscure games.

2. Difficult to break, easy to maintain

    *   Windows can be broken but it does require doing something stupid and it can be much easier to recover than Linux depending on how you messed up. A broken update can easily be undone sometimes even automatically for example, though newer Linux systems like Fedora Silverblue and NixOS do surpass or rival it in this regard.

### Windows Cons
1. Difficult installations
    *   On Windows it's not uncommon to have to chew through a few installers to set up the software you need.
2. Inflexible UX
    *   On Windows you can't move your taskbar to the side and you have very limited options for customization. 
3. The Spectre of AI integration
    *   This won't be a problem for everyone but the integrity of my information is very important to me. The encroachment of AI and LLMs into windows means I have to be careful when an LLM might be injecting information or digesting my writing for analysis and training

### Linux Pros
1. Software Availability
    *   On linux if software is available you grab it from the software store or maybe the package manager and get going. 
2. UX flexibility
    *   On linux you can have the UX work however you'd like thanks to GNOME extensions or KDE plasma or the massive collection of Window Managers out there. If you can dream it, there's a way to do it on linux.
3. The command line
    *   Linux allows a lot of flexibility through it's command line. While windows has this as well, Linux allows you to change or do just about anything through the terminal

### Linux Cons

1. Installing software not available through the store or your OS's repos can be a real pain
    *   Weird extra package managers, manual compilation, random appimage files and more, things not packaged for your OS can be a real pain to get working. The upside to this is that you can install even the weird stuff and with a little elbow grease you might even get to package it yourself to spare others the pain you went through
2. The 99% rule
    *   99% of your desktop will work really well! However there will always be a few annoying bugs you can't fix with your hardware or a few features that don't quite work. It's annoying and it's up to every person if it's worth it compared to Linux's competitors.
3. Unlimited Footgun Ammunition
    *   If you want to do something stupid linux won't stop you! Especially through the terminal. This can make the learning process quite frustrating.
