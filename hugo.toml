Content = "Hi there! I go by the Clockwork Critter online though you can call me whatever youâ€™d like, I use she/her and it/its pronouns. I am a Linux Enthusiast, Furry, and Aspiring Data Scientist. I enjoy learning about technology, statistics and data science, and digital privacy. I also enjoy humor and thinking about what makes a joke work. This website is dedicated to journaling my thoughts as I try finding my place in both the tech industry and the wider world as well as collecting resourses that help marginalized people navigate their challenges."
