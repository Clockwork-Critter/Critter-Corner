Xenia
Xenia is a Programmer for Crystal Linux. Her sense of humor, good natured personality, and willingness to help others uplift any community she is a part of. Eris
Polymath, Musician, Programmer, Activist, and Retro Technology Enthusiast. Eris brings knowledge, passion, and a unique sense of humor to any subject she encounters. It is impossible to be friends with Eris for long without learning something.</description>
