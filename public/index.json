In the very center of nothing, was everything. Everything opened its singular eye and beheld its opposite. It was a mighty creature and within itself, it contained every variation of every single possible moment, all at once. It was the mighty Worldbeast. But after eons of staring into the nothingness, its eye became bloodshot and the first crimson flower of madness began to bloom. In its fury eternity clawed at itself, finally tearing its eye asunder and fashioning the first god out of its most desperate wish, that it and every creature would one day die. The first god, the god of death took pity and struck, ending the life of the worldbeast. The nothing seeped into the gash in the corpse and ate every continuum except one. Thus it became that reality collapsed into a singular existence, moving forward an instant at a time.\nOver the centuries life evolved. As souls went through countless animalistic lives, they began to become sentient, and when they were severed from their forms they would cycle anew to the next form. But this was not without consequence, for a soul cast asunder will always seek the strongest source of power, and no power in all the lands can equal that of the discarded iris of the worldbeast, known as the iris of eternity. As the souls of the many races began to flow through the iris they left groves in the shape of their greatest feelings. Their fear, their hopes, and their desires. The weight of their narratives. Thus it became so that the godhead was formed, creating a pantheon of creatures embodying the strongest passions of the living. Each one of these creatures, termed gods, devils, and fae possess the infinite power of the iris, but can only act in accordance with the stories and ideas that spawned them.\nOver time these gods started to interact with mortals, changing their lives and themselves with it, and entering contracts with their worshipers, by imbedding parts of their power within the core of their souls. But opening your soul to a god is not without consequences. The more of a god is anchored to your soul, the more of their power you can wield yes, but the less of you that remains. One of the most famous paladins of light got to the point where he would do nothing in between battles but stare at the wall of the king’s throne room, unmoving and unmovable.\nSeeking freedom from this bargain and the whims of the often fickle gods, the first king sought a new power that might be wielded by the kingdom of man. He found it in a small peasant child brought to his throne with a strange ailment. The child could see things that weren’t there, not an uncommon phenomenon, but he could also bring them here, although he couldn’t keep them here for long. After decades of studying, the kingdom had discovered the power of in-potentia. For when the worldbeast died, the alternative moments did not disappear, they simply stopped existing. Those with power in their soul could reach into the void and pull forth objects and forces from these alternate times, as long as they can figure out how these things would happen. It became known that the key to wielding in-potenia is that everything that doesn’t exist, doesn’t exist somewhere, all a mage had to do is find where.\nFor a time, this was good, but then the first of the mages entered the throne room and slew the first king in a fit of madness. The exposure to so much information all the time had warped his mind, allowed him to see further than his mind could handle, and he had snapped under the pressure. The first prince ordered all the mages killed, but they saw this coming and fled the kingdom.\nIn modern times it is understood that the practice of magic, the wielding of in-potentia is a part of the world. Mages receive training, and often call forth mundane materials for the townspeople, shaping the economy of modern societies. The mages are taught the magi’s virtues: Insight or the ability to understand the world and figure out how to pull what’s needed from in-potentia, Power or the ability to pull large objects or significant powers from the void, and fortitude or the ability to withstand the effects of magic on your mind and body.\nLike in human bodies, the decaying of the worldbeast creates gasses. But unlike humans, the worldbeast’s corpse creates beautiful music. The majority of people can not hear it, however those with significant insight or power can almost make out the melody. Only those lost to madness or about to die can hear the lyrics.\nWorldbeast Axioms Like most settings, the worldbeast follows some general narrative rules for every story set inside it.\nThe world is an overwhelmingly dangerous place, the more you understand about it, the more you understand how fragile and insignificant you are. Mind control and other magical methods of mental coercion do not work. Every person in the worldbeast must make their own decisions, for better or worse. Every character will inevitably die. Resurrection is not possible, though things like litchdom are. Acts of in-potentia are inherently dangerous. There is no such thing as a safe spell or a sane magi. Insight is the seeing of things that are real and true or could become so. If they are not, then it is not insight. Gods in any form are dangerous and fickle, and the powers they offer have domain-related downsides. A fire god will offer powers that will burn the user if they are not careful for example. Saints are self-destructive and unstable. There is no such thing as a truly useful saint. In-potentia requires training, it can not be used on instinct, though it can be guided or directed in its raw state inside someone. The god of death is never met and never speaks. Eyes, music, and stories are important symbology and are never invoked lightly.

What we call things reflects how we interact with them. I used this principle when choosing my chosen name, picking something I believed fit my personality and my values. A username however is different. A username is not just a reflection of who you are, but a key part of shaping the way people respond to you online. A username can shape the gender people assign to you, but it can also impart a lot of personality that a first name can not. This is because a username is expected to be creative, whereas a name is meant to simply represent a person. This isn\u0026rsquo;t to say a username is more important but to say that it has different affordances than a real name.\nThe Clockwork I have always been fascinated by complex systems. The computer, the cell, human bodies, the list goes on. There is something endlessly fascinating about a bunch of lesser parts working together in order. And nothing summarizes this feeling for me more than clockwork. I love listening to the gears tick and watching them move on the pocketwatch my brother bought for me is so relaxing. It calls to mind a regimented, meticulous person(despite the number of spelling and grammatical errors this blog will no doubt contain), who enjoys fine details which is how I like people to think of me. Therefore, the Clockwork part of the name felt perfectly natural. In addition, while I often struggle to identify body sensations like muscle pain or hunger, visualizing myself as made of gears makes them easier to identify, which makes my affinity for the term even stronger.\nThe Critter When we think of a human a lot of things come to mind. Jobs, school, marriage, and a plethora of other assorted societal expectations for what one is supposed to do. So while I am physically a human, I like to use the word critter to detach myself from them when making decisions about what I should do. That way even when I make these decisions it is more likely that I am doing what I think is best rather than following precedent. In addition, critter is an endearing and friendly sounding word which is the energy I try to bring into my interactions with people whose company I enjoy.\n","permalink":"https://clockwork-critter.github.io/Critter-Corner/blog/choosing-a-username/","summary":"On Names I have always been a believer in the importance of a name.

Then I am told came social media sites. They provided an easier way to get your thoughts out into the world. No code, markup, or page design is needed; just write and get directly to sharing. This came with a big boom in popularity for the internet in general as well as these sites in particular; to not use them was to become irrelevant, at least in the eyes of the net. The biggest social media platforms have user counts in the tens and sometimes even hundreds of millions, using their platforms to broadcast their ideas every day. That\u0026rsquo;s a lot of posts. In fact, according to InternetLiveStats Twitter sees 6,000 tweets a second. There, of course, comes a new problem. I\u0026rsquo;d call this the modern problem. There is so much of everyone\u0026rsquo;s thoughts that everything becomes ephemeral; even when posts stay up for long periods, they are functionally \u0026ldquo;gone,\u0026rdquo; or better to say irrelevant, within a day. This is unless you have either a large amount of money or insight into a sizeable chunk of the user base. Given that we are presumably possessed by neither our options for cataloging our thoughts despite the best efforts of many are to be irrelevant to the affordances of either social media or those of a website.\nThe Affordances of Social Media It is reasonable to assume that because this is written on a website I am against social media but this is not so. In fact, on my main page, I have several social media pages. Social media has the advantage of allowing people to share content with friends and share a uniform experience with other users. Social media is at its best when it allows people to share small portions of their work, short thoughts or experiences with other people, especially fast-moving things like status updates or project announcements. I use social media to get updates from artists, tech projects, and personal friends. I also use it to discuss my interests with other like-minded individuals. Social media is at its best when it is used as a connective medium, it isn’t for creating a repository of thoughts as much as it is to connect people.\nThe Affordances of a Website So, when does one want to make a website? Well, a personal website is static. As long as it is maintained it provides the same content to each visitor. This means that is a better storage medium for thoughts and opinions, especially longer-form ones. This was one of the major objectives for making this website. As I progress to my professional life, and work through my academic life, I find myself with more thoughts in need of an outlet. The static nature of a website of this nature is ideal for this because it allows me to look and refer back to these thoughts as needed. In contrast, things like reach and allowing others to comment on the site are less important and thus social media is less appropriate.\nHow the Site was Made and Why This website is hosted on Neocities and created directly in HTML and CSS. To make new pages and test layout changes I use Visual Studio Codium, a free software build of VSCode with the telemetry removed with the extension Five Server to let me make live changes and see the results instantly. With plenty of simpler options, like WordPress, why make a website this way? Well, it\u0026rsquo;s because as an information sciences student having a variety of skills is useful. This site serves as an excuse to learn HTML and CSS, and it allows me to practice self-teaching complex technical skills, a meta-skill that is very important for a fast-paced environment like the tech industry.\nHow the Site was Made and Why (Redux) Recently I decided to change the site-building process from my own HTML and CSS to Hugo, a static site generator. This enables much faster website creation and makes it easier for me to correctly group content. This new version of the site will be hosted on a static web host, GitHub Pages, and given a custom domain (which, unlike neocities, GitHub offers the use of custom domains for free.)\n","permalink":"https://clockwork-critter.github.io/Critter-Corner/blog/the-making-of-a-website/","summary":"Websites and Social Media In the early days of the internet, years before I would use it at all, it was commonplace to have personal websites.
